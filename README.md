# Iris Flower Data Exploration and Visualization

## **Task Objective**

The objective of this project is to explore and visualize the famous Iris dataset to understand the relationships between flower measurements and species. This project focuses on basic data analysis, preprocessing, and visual insights.

---

## **Dataset Description**

* **Name:** Iris Dataset
* **Source:** Dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
* **Number of Instances:** 150
* **Number of Features:** 4 numerical (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) and 1 categorical (Species)
* **Number of Classes:** 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
* **Balanced:** Yes

---

## **Steps Performed**

1. **Data Loading** – Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Inspection** – Checked data shape, column names, and summary statistics.
3. **Data Visualization** – Created scatter plots, histograms, and other visualizations to explore relationships between features.
4. **Preprocessing** – Dropped non-numeric data for numeric analysis.

---

## **Key Findings**

* Petal measurements show clearer separation between species than sepal measurements.
* The dataset is clean, with no missing values.
* Basic visualizations help in understanding the distribution of each feature and their relationships.

---

## **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations

Do you want me to **upgrade this README** so it also includes a *model training and results section*? That would make it fit the internship submission format perfectly.
